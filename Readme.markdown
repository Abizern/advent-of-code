# Advent of Code

My solutions to Advent of Code puzzles.

## Why Common Lisp

I'm not a proficient Lisper. This is a chance for me to learn the language and just try and code solutions without worrying about whether I'm doing it the _right_ way.

- Big number support
- Dynamic typing, really handy for these sorts of problems
- Very easy to work in the REPL

## Usage

This is a package to make it easier to have common code (think Intcode, etc), but generally each day lives in it's own file and can be run in the REPL.

There is scope for tests, but as it' so easy to work in the REPL in Lisp I am unlikely to be using TDD. I'll circle back around to it when I can use my idea of having a macro for the test suite.

# Installation

Just stick it somewhere Quicklisp can find it.
