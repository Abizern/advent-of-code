g# Advent of Code

My solutions to Advent of Code puzzles.

## Why Common Lisp

I'm not a proficient Lisper. This is a chance for me to learn the language and just try and code solutions without worrying about whether I'm doing it the _right_ way.

- Big number support
- Dynamic typing, really handy for these sorts of problems
- Very easy to work in the REPL

## Usage

Just load the file (with Sly in my case) and hack away. I decided it was a waste of time trying to make this into a package.

There is scope for tests, but as it's so easy to work in the REPL in Lisp I am unlikely to be using TDD. I'll circle back around to it when I can use my idea of having a macro for the test suite.

## Installation

Just stick it somewhere Quicklisp can find it.

## Sly documentation

Since I used Sly here's the link to the documentation https://joaotavora.github.io/sly/
